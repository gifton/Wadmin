## Wesaturate Admin Application 

For official use only 

Wadmin is a mobile application written with swift 5.0 to allow our employees to view site analytics, and approve/best/reject/delete photos

Wadmin relies in a minute amount of dependancies using cocoapods:
* IQKeyboardManager - UI
* AlamoFire - Networking

To use the application, confirm you are set as an admin with [gifton](https://github.com/gifton) or [Kash](https://github.com/kash).  Then login on the application to become authenticated

To use you must have xcode 10.3 and swift 5.0.1, and (cocoapods)[https://cocoapods.org/]

### instilation
* clone repo into desired folder
* run pod install to install required dependancies
* open the .xcworkspace folder (the white one, NOT the blue one) 
* change target output device in top left to your iphone that is plugged into your laptop, or connected to your network
* cmd + r
